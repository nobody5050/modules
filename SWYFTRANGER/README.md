Empower your FTC or FRC robot with Swyft Ranger, the ultimate Lidar distance sensor designed to give you the edge in competition. Engineered by Swyft Robotics, this compact yet powerful sensor delivers accuracy, reliability, and versatility, making it the perfect tool for game element detection and navigation.

**Key Features:**

- **Simple and Reliable**: Ditch the unreliable I2C bus or complicated CAN bus. Swyft Ranger offers analog or digital output with no configuration required for seamless integration with your robot's control system.
- **Exceptional Range and Accuracy**: Boasting a maximum distance of 10 feet with millimeter resolution.
- **Adaptable Ranging Modes**: Three distinct ranging modes (wide, moderate, narrow) allow you to tailor the sensor's field of view (FOV) to your specific needs, whether you're navigating tight spaces or detecting game elements inside your robot.
- **Optional Digital Output**: Switch to "detect mode" to generate a digital output, simplifying object detection and triggering actions based on a configurable distance.
- **Ultra-Compact Design**: With a footprint of just 31mm x 24mm x 12mm, Swyft Ranger fits seamlessly into any robot design without sacrificing valuable space.
- **Durable Construction**: Housed in a robust SLS nylon case, Swyft Ranger is built to withstand the rigors of competition.
- **Easy Mounting**: 3mm mounting holes spaced at 24mm allow for quick and secure installation.
- **Hassle-Free Wiring**: A 4-pin JST PH connector ensures easy connection to your REV Control Hub, Expansion Hub, or RoboRIO for FRC teams.
